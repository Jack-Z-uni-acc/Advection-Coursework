    Parameters:

                         the latest value of phi, to be updated.

    Parameters:

def CTCS(phiLevels, c):

    Author: Hilary Weller <h.weller@reading.ac.uk>
    Solves the linear advection equation for one time step using CTCS.
    phiLevels is updated. Nothing is returned.
    If phiLevels contains just one array, then FTCS is used instead.
    Parameters:
        phiLevels ([1darray,1darray]): A list of two consecutive values of phi.
                   If only one is present, the next is created using FTCS.
        c (float): The Courant number
